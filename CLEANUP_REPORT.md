# ðŸ§¹ Codebase Cleanup Report

## Summary
This report details the cleanup performed on the `apps-builder` repository to remove dead files and improve code organization.

## Files Removed

### Debug & Test Files (Deleted)
- `apps/asset-evaluation/debug-db.ts` - Database debugging script
- `apps/asset-evaluation/debug-questions.ts` - Questions debugging script
- `apps/asset-evaluation/test-form-submission.js` - Form submission test script
- `apps/sass-starter/test-password.ts` - Password testing script
- `apps/sass-starter/test-integrations.js` - Integrations testing script

### Empty Files (Deleted)
- `apps/asset-evaluation/check-fields.ts` - Empty file
- `apps/asset-evaluation/check-fields.js` - Empty file
- `apps/house-evaluation-test/drop-tables.ts` - Empty file

### Duplicate Documentation Files (Deleted/Moved)
- `NEXTJS_USE_SERVER_BEST_PRACTICES.md` - Content included in `.github/instructions/nextjs-best-practices.instructions.md`
- `TURBOREPO_CODE_GENERATION_GUIDE.md` - Exact duplicate of `.github/instructions/turbo-monorepo.instructions.md`
- `NEXTJS_SERVER_ACTIONS_BEST_PRACTICES.md` - Content integrated into `.github/instructions/nextjs-best-practices.instructions.md`

### Files Reorganized to Instructions
- `PROJECT_IMPROVEMENT_GUIDE.md` â†’ `.github/instructions/project-improvement.instructions.md` (with proper instruction format)

### Files Restored
- `CLAUDE.md` - Restored as it's used by another AI model (Claude) and serves a different purpose than GitHub Copilot instructions

## Files Reorganized

### Moved to Scripts Folders
The following files were moved from root directories to appropriate `scripts/` folders for better organization:

**apps/sass-starter/scripts/**
- `clean-database.ts` - Database cleanup script
- `create-content-tables.ts` - Content tables creation script
- `seed-integrations.ts` - Integrations seeding script
- `seed-team-data.ts` - Team data seeding script
- `manual-user-profiles-migration.sql` - Manual SQL migration
- `content-migration.sql` - Content migration SQL

**apps/asset-evaluation/scripts/**
- `consolidate-fields.ts` - Fields consolidation script

**apps/house-evaluation-test/scripts/**
- `apply-migration.ts` - Migration application script
- `manual-migration.sql` - Manual SQL migration

## Updated .gitignore

Enhanced `.gitignore` to prevent these types of files from being accidentally committed:

```ignore
# Debug files
debug-*.ts
debug-*.js
test-*.ts
test-*.js

# Database maintenance scripts (keep in scripts/ folders only)
clean-database.ts
drop-tables.ts
apply-migration.ts
create-*-tables.ts
seed-*.ts
consolidate-*.ts

# Temporary files
temp-*
tmp-*
*.tmp
*.temp
```

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Repository**: Removed unnecessary debug, test, and duplicate documentation files
2. **Better Organization**: Database scripts are now properly organized in `scripts/` folders
3. **Eliminated Redundancy**: Removed duplicate documentation that was already covered in instruction files
4. **Prevents Future Clutter**: Updated `.gitignore` prevents similar files from being committed
5. **Improved Navigation**: Easier to find and maintain actual application code
6. **Reduced Repository Size**: Eliminated dead and duplicate files that serve no purpose

## Recommendations

1. **Use `scripts/` folders**: Place all database maintenance, seeding, and utility scripts in dedicated `scripts/` folders
2. **Temporary files**: Use prefixes like `temp-`, `debug-`, or `test-` for temporary files and ensure they're gitignored
3. **Regular cleanup**: Perform similar cleanups periodically to maintain code hygiene
4. **Code review**: Include file cleanup as part of the code review process

## Script Usage

Database maintenance scripts are now organized and can be run as needed:

```bash
# Clean database (sass-starter)
npx tsx apps/sass-starter/scripts/clean-database.ts

# Create content tables (sass-starter)
npx tsx apps/sass-starter/scripts/create-content-tables.ts

# Apply migration (house-evaluation-test)
npx tsx apps/house-evaluation-test/scripts/apply-migration.ts
```

## Final Summary

### Total Files Cleaned:
- **Dead/Debug Files Removed**: 8 files
- **Database Scripts Reorganized**: 9 files moved to `scripts/` folders  
- **Documentation Consolidated**: 3 duplicate files removed, 1 moved to instructions
- **Files Restored**: 1 file (`CLAUDE.md`) restored for another AI model
- **Enhanced .gitignore**: Added patterns to prevent future clutter

### Repository Status:
âœ… **Clean and organized** - No more dead files cluttering the root directories  
âœ… **Better structure** - All maintenance scripts properly organized  
âœ… **Consolidated documentation** - All guidance centralized in `.github/instructions/`  
âœ… **Future-proofed** - `.gitignore` prevents similar issues

The repository is now much cleaner, better organized, and ready for productive development.
