/**
 * Deployment Fix Summary
 * 
 * Issue: ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE deployment failure
 * Error: "Cannot install with 'frozen-lockfile' because pnpm-lock.yaml is not up to date with package.json"
 * 
 * Root Cause:
 * - The pnpm-lock.yaml file had different package specifications than package.json
 * - Jest was added as a devDependency but the lockfile wasn't updated
 * - Lockfile still had all packages listed as regular dependencies
 * - CI/CD environments use frozen-lockfile mode which prevents mismatched installs
 * 
 * Resolution Applied:
 * 1. ✅ Ran `pnpm install` to update lockfile with current package.json structure
 * 2. ✅ Verified proper separation of dependencies vs devDependencies
 * 3. ✅ Confirmed build process works correctly with updated lockfile
 * 4. ✅ Committed and pushed updated pnpm-lock.yaml to repository
 * 
 * Verification:
 * - ✅ Build completed successfully (prebuild + Next.js compilation)
 * - ✅ Translation system validation passed (273 keys synchronized)
 * - ✅ All dependencies properly resolved and installed
 * - ✅ Lockfile now matches package.json specifications exactly
 * 
 * Expected Result:
 * - Deployment should now succeed without lockfile errors
 * - CI environment will be able to install dependencies in frozen mode
 * - Both production dependencies and devDependencies properly configured
 * 
 * Files Modified:
 * - pnpm-lock.yaml (updated to match current package.json structure)
 * 
 * Commit: 766548f - "fix: update pnpm-lock.yaml to sync with package.json dependencies"
