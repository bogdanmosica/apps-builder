    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "subtitle": "Everything you need to know about smart property evaluation",
    "q1": {
      "question": "Do you sell properties or work with realtors?",
      "answer": "No, we're completely independent. We don't sell properties, take commissions, or have partnerships with realtors. We're just a tool to help you make better decisions. You can use any realtor you want, or none at all."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "Is this really free?",
      "answer": "Yes! The basic checklist features are completely free forever. We offer premium features like advanced analytics and unlimited property comparisons for a small monthly fee, but most people find the free version has everything they need."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "Can I trust you with my property search data?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Your property data is encrypted and private. We never sell your information or share it with realtors, lenders, or anyone else. You can export or delete your data anytime. We make money from premium subscriptions, not from your personal information."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "How does the scoring system work?",
      "answer": "Our smart scoring system weighs different factors based on what you tell us is important. Location, condition, price, and amenities all get scored on a 1-10 scale, then combined into an overall score. You can adjust the weightings to match your priorities."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "What if I'm not tech-savvy?",
      "answer": "No problem! The app is designed to be simple - just answer questions about each property you visit. If you can text or use basic apps, you can use this. Plus, it works offline so you don't need to worry about connectivity during property visits."
    },
    "q6": {
      "question": "Can I use this for rental properties or investments?",
      "answer": "Yes! While we designed it primarily for home buyers, the checklists work great for rental property evaluation too. You can customize the questions and scoring to focus on investment criteria like rental yield, maintenance costs, and tenant appeal. The family sharing features also work well for investment partners or property management teams."
