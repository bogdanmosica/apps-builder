# Team Settings Implementation

This implementation provides a complete, dynamic Team settings tab with full database integration for team management, member invitations, role management, and member removal.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (Already Existing)

**Tables Used:**
- `teams` - Team information with subscription details
- `team_members` - User-team relationships with roles
- `invitations` - Pending team invitations
- `activity_logs` - Audit trail for team actions

### 2. Server Actions

**File: `lib/actions/team-settings.ts`**
- `getTeamData()` - Fetches team with members and pending invitations
- `inviteTeamMember()` - Sends team invitations with role validation
- `updateMemberRole()` - Updates team member roles with permission checks
- `removeMember()` - Removes team members with safety checks
- `cancelInvitation()` - Cancels pending invitations
- Full permission validation and activity logging

### 3. React Component

**File: `components/settings/team-settings.tsx`**
- Complete team management interface
- Real-time member list with role badges
- Role-based permission system
- Invitation management with pending status
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Toast notifications for all actions

### 4. Enhanced Settings Integration

**Updated: `components/enhanced-settings.tsx`**
- Added TeamData interface type definitions
- Integrated Team tab with dynamic data
- Proper prop passing to team component

**Updated: `app/(dashboard)/dashboard/settings/page.tsx`**
- Fetches both user and team data
- Passes data to enhanced settings component

## Features

### Team Overview Section
- ✅ Team name and creation date display

- ✅ Role hierarchy enforcement
- ✅ Single admin protection (cannot remove last admin)

### Invitation System

- ✅ Invitation cancellation
- ✅ Invitation status tracking with timestamps

### Permission System
- ✅ Role-based UI rendering

- ✅ Server-side permission checks
- ✅ Safety checks for critical operations
- ✅ Admin/owner requirement enforcement

### Activity Logging
- ✅ All team actions logged to activity_logs table
- ✅ Detailed action descriptions
- ✅ User attribution for all actions
- ✅ Timestamp tracking

### UI/UX Features
- ✅ Responsive design for all screen sizes
- ✅ Loading states for all async operations
- ✅ Error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ Toast notifications for action feedback
- ✅ Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- ✅ Color-coded role badges with icons
- ✅ Dropdown menus for member actions
- ✅ Empty states for teams without members

## Technical Implementation

### Server Actions Pattern
```typescript
// Example: Team member invitation
export async function inviteTeamMember(formData: FormData) {
  // 1. Authentication check
  // 2. Permission validation
  // 3. Data validation with Zod
  // 4. Business logic checks (duplicates, etc.)
  // 5. Database operations
  // 6. Activity logging
  // 7. Cache revalidation
  // 8. Response with success/error
}
```

### Permission Validation
```typescript
// Permission checks throughout the application
const canManageTeam = ['admin', 'owner'].some(role => 
  teamData.currentUserRole?.includes(role)
);

// Server-side validation
if (!['admin', 'owner'].some(role => teamData.currentUserRole?.includes(role))) {
  return { success: false, message: 'You do not have permission' };
}
```

### Role Management
- **Owner**: Ultimate authority, cannot be removed or demoted
- **Admin**: Can invite, remove, and change roles of members
- **Member**: Standard team access, cannot manage others
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to team information

### Safety Mechanisms
- Last admin protection (cannot remove/demote sole admin)
- Self-removal prevention for sole admin
- Duplicate invitation prevention
- Existing member check before invitation
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

## Database Operations

### Team Data Fetching
```typescript
// Complex query with relations
const result = await db.query.teamMembers.findFirst({
  where: eq(teamMembers.userId, user.id),
  with: {
    team: {
      with: {
        teamMembers: {
          with: {
            user: {
              columns: { id: true, name: true, email: true, createdAt: true }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
});
```

### Activity Logging
```typescript
// All team actions are logged
await db.insert(activityLogs).values({
  teamId: teamData.team.id,
  userId: user.id,
  action: `INVITE_TEAM_MEMBER: ${email} as ${role}`,
  ipAddress: null, // Could be enhanced
});
```

## Component Architecture

### Main Component Structure
```
TeamSettings
├── Team Overview Card
│   ├── Team name and stats
│   └── Invite member dialog
├── Team Members Card
│   ├── Member list with actions
│   └── Role management dropdowns
├── Pending Invitations Card
│   ├── Invitation list
│   └── Cancel invitation actions
└── Confirmation Dialogs
    └── Remove member confirmation
```

### State Management
- `isInviteDialogOpen` - Controls invitation dialog
- `confirmRemoveDialogOpen` - Controls removal confirmation
- `memberToRemove` - Tracks member being removed
- Multiple `useTransition` hooks for loading states

## Testing Data

A seed script (`seed-team-data.ts`) has been provided to create test data:
- Sample team with members
- Different role assignments
- Pending invitations
- Proper relationships

## Usage Examples

### Inviting a Team Member
1. Click "Invite Member" button
2. Enter email address
3. Select role (Viewer, Member, Admin)
4. Click "Send Invitation"
5. Invitation appears in pending section

### Managing Member Roles
1. Click three-dot menu next to member
2. Select new role from dropdown
3. Role is updated immediately with confirmation

### Removing a Team Member
1. Click three-dot menu next to member
2. Select "Remove Member"
3. Confirm in dialog
4. Member is removed from team

## Security Considerations

- ✅ Server-side permission validation
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Input validation with Zod schemas
- ✅ SQL injection prevention with Drizzle
- ✅ CSRF protection via Next.js forms
- ✅ Activity logging for audit trails

This implementation provides a comprehensive team management system that's production-ready with proper security, validation, and user experience considerations.
